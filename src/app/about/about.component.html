<p class="studio">Studio Ghibli was founded in 
    1985 by directors Hayao Miyazaki and 
    Isao Takahata and producer Toshio Suzuki,
     but Miyazaki and Takahata have a relationship
      that far predates this. The pair first worked
       together in 1964, marking the beginning of 
       a collaborative relationship that would 
       carry on throughout their careers.</p>
